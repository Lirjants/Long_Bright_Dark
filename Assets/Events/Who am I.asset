  description: "I see a face in the mirror. It\u2019s not mine. Or maybe it is. \u201CI\u201D
    is currently very malleable concept. Mostly because I have no idea who \u201CI\u201D
    entails. I try to look for signs who this enigmatic \u201CI\u201D was. Maybe
    they were a rockstar? Or an artist? Most likely not. Those kinds of people usually
    don\u2019t end up alone in the complete dark. God I wish I was a rockstar instead. "
