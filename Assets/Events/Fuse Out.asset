  description: "Fuses, the eternal enemy of anyone that wants to get shit done. They
    wait to ambush you when you\u2019re at your most vulnerable. Trapdoor spiders
    of electric world, I call them. Gleefully rubbing their little wires together
    while you\u2019re working on some world changing invention, and then CLICK! and
    all your precious documents are gone. Darn it. "
