  description: "There is something with me there. I don\u2019t see it, but I hear
    it. Scurrying around in the rooms, crawling inside the walls. It\u2019s waiting
    for me to turn on the lights. The moment they blare on, its damnable existence
    is undeniable. I will keep the lights out. So it won\u2019t be. Just me and the
    dark and the sounds and the dark and me and the creature in the dark "
