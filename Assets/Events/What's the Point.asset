    exact the same as the last one. So was yesterday. So will be tomorrow. Things
    don\u2019t change. Time flows into endless grey sludge of minutes, hours and
    days. This will be another day wasted doing menial shit that doesn\u2019t affect
    anything and that no-one will remember. Ever. Not even me. I\u2019m just gonna
    lay the entire day in bed and feel bad for myself. I\u2019m sure that will solve
    everything. "
