  description: While running some tests, I dozed off. I was back at my family summer
    cabin. In the changing room between the house and the sauna. The water ripples
    reflected of the sun swayed playfully in the ceiling and I heard the waves breaking
    against the little rocky beach. When I woke up, I felt more rested than I had
    in many nights.
