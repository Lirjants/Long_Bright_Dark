  description: "You could boil an egg on my forehead. Room spins and blurs. I feel
    my blood slowly rushing around my body. There\u2019s a miniscule war ongoing
    inside me and Lord, no matter who is winning, I am losing. Antibiotics deployed,
    sir! Get the white blood cell production on overdrive! Will fry those damn bacteria,
    even if it sets the whole system on blaze"
