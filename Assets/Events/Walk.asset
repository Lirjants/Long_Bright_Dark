  description: "Taking a little jog on the edge of the crater, I tried my best to
    step in each exact step I did the last time. It\u2019s strangely comforting seeing
    your own tracks. A testament that in all this darkness, I was here. When I walked
    back, I kicked bit of the dust and watched it fall. Like a little rain of ashes. "
